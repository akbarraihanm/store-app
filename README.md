## Tech Stack & Architecture

### State Management

This project is using BLoC as a state management ([BLoC Pub Dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)).
Separate UI logic code & UI code, will increase the code performance. Also make it easier 
to be maintained.

![Mechanism](https://bloclibrary.dev/_astro/bloc_architecture_full.CYn-T9Ox_Z20Hwr9.webp)

UI listen to the state & request by call/add an event to trigger the state, 
and then BLoC give them the data & manage the UI state.

### Clean Architecture

We separate *data*, *domain*, and *presentation* layer so that development and testing
progress is more effective.

### Unit Test
We do a unit test, such as domain layer like :

1. data layer
    - data source
    - repository
    - models (body & response)
2. domain layer
    - use case
    - entities
